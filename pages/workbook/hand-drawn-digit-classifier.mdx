# Setup

This project can be done on Google Colaboratory (Colab). However, to do so, you will need to sign into your Google Account. Once you have done so, visit [Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/) and create a new **.ipynb** file by clicking **New Notebook**. You will see a new empty notebook with a single empty code cell.

# About the Project

You will be building an image classifier using [keras](https://keras.io/). The machine learning model used is a [CNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (Convolutional Neural Network) and will be classifying Hand Drawn Digits from the renowned [mnist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) dataset.

# Preparing the Dataset

Our **CNN** needs images to train on, specifically images of the Hand Drawn Digits. Thankfully, **keras** has an inbuilt method to load the dataset. Let's import **keras**, then use its function.

```
from keras.datasets import mnist
data = mnist.load_data()
```

# Splitting Data

Our **data** variable is currently a **tuple**. We need to split it into **train** and **test** sections. Why we do so is quite simple: you should separate your data into train and test splits to prevent your model from overfitting and to accurately evaluate your model.

```
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = data
```

There's 2 types of train and test lists, X and Y. X stores all the values for the pixels of each image, while Y stores the labels for each image. Our end goal is to ensure that our machine can read in X and produce something close to Y.

Each element in X_train is an image. Kinda. Each digit is drawn on a canvas **28 by 28 pixels** in size. Each pixel has a value ranging from 0 to 255 (its intensity). There is data for 60,000 images in X_train. This can be seen when running the line below.
```
X_train.shape()
```

What do you think the dimensions of a list with shape (5,6) would be?

    correctAnsIndex={1}
    correctMessage="That's right!"
    wrongMessage="Are you sure? Try again."
/>

# Shaping the data

We have to **shape** the data to make sure that our model can understand it well. To do so, we reshape the lists so that their pixel values range from 0 to 1 instead of 0 to 255.

```
X_train = X_train.reshape((X_train.shape[0], 28*28)).astype('float32')
X_test = X_test.reshape((X_test.shape[0], 28*28)).astype('float32')

X_train = X_train / 255
X_test = X_test / 255
```

The Y lists contain labels for the images i.e '1' '2' ... These next lines catergorize the lists.

```
from keras.utils import np_utils

y_train = np_utils.to_categorical(y_train)
y_test = np_utils.to_categorical(y_test)
```

# It's time to build the model!

Every machine learning model is different. In our case, we are using a CNN. A CNN runs on **layers**. Each layer takes in certain inputs and produces certain outputs.
In our CNN for this task, we will need to use 2 types of layers. We import the **Sequential** (a layer-by-layer based model) model and the [**Dense**](https://analyticsindiamag.com/a-complete-understanding-of-dense-layers-in-neural-networks/#:~:text=Sign%20up-,What%20is%20a%20Dense%20Layer%3F,in%20artificial%20neural%20network%20networks) layer. These are pre-defined tools we can use to make it significantly faster to make a CNN.
We also need [activation functions](https://towardsdatascience.com/activation-functions-neural-networks-1cbd9f8d91d6). They determine decides whether a neuron should be activated or not by finding weighted sums and further adding some bias to it. These functions exist is to add non-linearity into the output of a neuron.
```
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

model = Sequential() #instantiate the model

model.add(Dense(32, input_dim = 28 * 28, activation= 'relu')) #define the first Layer of the model --> A Dense layer which takes in an input of size 28 by 28 and has an output of size 32 

model.add(Dense(64, activation = 'relu')) # second layer

model.add(Dense(10, activation  = 'softmax')) # third layer
```

Next, we compile the model. We use a loss function which compares the target and predicted output values and measures how well the neural network models the training data. The optimizer used is 'Adam' as it is fast, and easy to run. Lastly, we use the metrics of accuraccy to determine the model's effectiveness.

```
model.compile(loss = 'categorical_crossentropy', optimizer = 'adam', metrics = ['accuracy'])
model.summary()
```

The summary shows information about our model. 

# Time to train our model!

It's the part you've been waiting for! Time to train our model! We 'fit' the model by providing the data we want it to analyse, the correct answers, the number of epochs (how many cycles of training it goes through) and the batch size (the number of training examples used in one epoch).
This might take some time, so go grab a drink!

```
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs= 10, batch_size = 100)
```

It might not seem like it, but now you have a fully functioning neural network ready to be tested!

# Testing the model

Our model is done! To make sure it learnt correctly, we must give it a test! We can evaluate the model based on the metric of Accuraccy as we stated above. The value is returned between 0 and 1 so multiplying it by 100 shows the percentage accuraccy.

```
scores = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print('Accuracy: ',scores[1] * 100)
```

I hope the accuraccy of yours is above 95! That should be a good mark of a 'good-enough' CNN for our case. Now, we can save the model below and finally be able to tell others that 'I can make a Neural Network that can classify the digits you write!'

```
model_name = input('What is the name of the model?: ')
model.save(model_name)
```

I hope you learnt the basics of how python can be used to easily create and develop machine learning projects. Do learn and explore more! This just the tip of the iceberg.
